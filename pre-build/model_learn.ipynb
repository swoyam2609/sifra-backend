It's brave of you to share this with me. It sounds like you're feeling stuck between wanting to fulfill your dad's wishes and pursuing your passion for acting. \\n\\nIt's important to remember that your dad's expectations are coming from a place of love and care, even if they don't quite understand your aspirations.  It's also important to be true to yourself and pursue your own happiness. \\n\\nLet's explore some ways you can navigate this situation:\\n\\n* **Open and Honest Communication:**  Having an open and honest conversation with your dad is crucial. You can share your feelings and explain that you're not finding fulfillment in your current path, and that you have a strong desire to pursue acting. \\n* **Expressing Gratitude:**  Start by acknowledging and appreciating his love and support.  Let him know that you value his expectations and understand where they come from.\\n* **Sharing your Passion:**  Share your passion for acting with him. Talk about your dreams, what excites you about it, and the steps you're taking to pursue it. \\n* **Setting Realistic Expectations:**  It might be helpful to have a conversation about setting realistic expectations.  Maybe you can compromise by exploring ways to balance your acting ambitions with some level of academic success. \\n* **Show your Dedication:**  Prove to your dad that you're serious about your acting goals.  Take acting classes, audition for plays, and build a portfolio to showcase your talent. \\n\\nRemember, this is your life, and you have the right to choose your own path. It might be a journey with bumps and turns, but with open communication and dedication, you can find a way to move forward towards your dreams while maintaining a strong and healthy relationship with your dad. \\n\\nIf you're struggling to communicate with your dad, or if the pressure is becoming overwhelming, it might be helpful to consider seeking guidance from a trusted friend, family member, or a therapist who can support you in navigating these feelings and finding the right path forward.\",\n",
